## Netlify configuration for the company-openings-app
## This config tells Netlify how to build and publish the site.
## Branch to deploy: main (set in Netlify site settings or by pushing to main)

[build]
  # Command Netlify runs to build the site
  command = "npm run build"
  # Directory containing the production-ready files from `vite build`
  publish = "dist"
  # Directory for serverless functions (optional)
  functions = "netlify/functions"
  # Base directory where Netlify will run the build command (project root)
  base = "."

[context.production]
  # Ensures production deploys use the same build/publish settings
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  # Example environment variables you can set per-site in the Netlify UI instead
  # NODE_VERSION = "18"

## Redirects for a Vite single-page app so client-side routing works.
## Netlify supports the `[[redirects]]` array in netlify.toml.
